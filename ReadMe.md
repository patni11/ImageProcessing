Three packages make up this image processing project, interactions, model, and modifications. In the interactions package, you will find the ImageUtil class which contains the readPPM method. The readPPM method takes a file name, attempts to retrieve that file, then converts it to our Image object. This leads us to the next package called model which houses the Image, ImageStorage, and the Pixel. The Pixel object is a simple object that holds an r, g, and b value. We made this to represent our image as a two-dimensional list of Pixels rather than all of the individual RGB values. The Image object contains all of the metadata and data that the ppm image had, but is better organized for us to interact with all the individual components of the ppm file. We then have an ImageStorage to store the Image objects we create. This class contains a hashmap of Strings representing the names of Images and their respective Image objects. The modifications package contains all of the function objects that take in an image and modifies it in a specific way. These functions are as follows: Brighten, changes all pixels by the provided argument brightens with a positive value and darkens with a negative value; flip, flips the image horizontally or vertically depending on the argument; greyscale, turns the image to greyscale depending on different components according to the argument provided; load, retrieve an image from the file system and adds it to our ImageStorage; and save, writes a new file and saves the image to the file system. These functions all implement our PPMModification interface. The main function adds all of these functions to our knownCommands hashmap, then prompts the user for input in the format: function-name <space> optional-function-argument <space> image-name <space> desired-new-image-name. The exception to this format is for load and save which are in the format: function-name <space> file-name <space> image-name. There is also a file that contains our starting images and testing images as well as a testing file.  There is also a controller interface as well as an implementation of that controller so that the main method does not directly change the model.

The script is meant to be typed in line by line one at a time.  Each new one is a separate command and after running each line provided, there should be new modified images in the ImageProcessing folder.

Example images were created by us using GIMP.  We aren't citing anyone because we didn't take the images from anywhere.
